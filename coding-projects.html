             Reverse Horoscope
           </div>
           <div class="box-body">
             I do not believe in Astrology. However, I do believe that what pulls many towards
             Astrology is the act of reading something that seems like it's written for them
             and deciding whether or not it applies to you. Why not take out the middle man?
             In my Reverse Horoscope, I take daily horoscopes from other websites, teaching
             myself how to web scrape with JSoup, and have the user select which body of text
             applies to them in a two-part quiz, then saying which "sign" they are based on
             their answers.

             Scoobie Cipher
           </div>
           <div class="box-body">
           Based on an assignment to make a simple cipher in my Object Oriented Programming course,
           I was hit with inspiration. What if the encrypted text of a message could be translated
           further into something delightful: perhaps something kin to the acclaimed nonsense of, say,
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8"> Scatman John </a>? Thus, the Scoobie
           Cipher was born. A shadow of Scoobie Cipher's potential was submitted for credit, in the
           interest of prioritizing my school work, but it will reach its true glory. Soon.
