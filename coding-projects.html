             Reverse Horoscope
           </div>
           <div class="box-body">
             I do not believe in Astrology. However, I do believe that what pulls many towards
             Astrology is the act of reading something that seems like it's written for them
             and deciding whether or not it applies to you. Why not take out the middle man?
             In my Reverse Horoscope, I take daily horoscopes from other websites, teaching
             myself how to web scrape with JSoup, and have the user select which body of text
             applies to them in a two-part quiz, then saying which "sign" they are based on
             their answers.

             ScoobieCipher
           </div>
           <div class="box-body">
			   ScoobieCipher is, in short, an RSA program that includes a second decorative cipher that I
			   created.
			   My Object-Oriented Programming class inspired this project with the assignment 
			   of creating a cipher, though none of the code here is from the homework (in which I used 
			   a double Xor cipher), and inspired from a presentation that a professor, Dr. Bidner,
			   gave at an Association of Computing Machinery meeting about RSA. Though much of it was new
			   My favorite and most challening feature was the ScoobieCipher itself, as creating it from 
			   scratch took trial and error, but seeing a sequences of bytes is not nearly as fun as a 
			   sequence of "Scoobie Doo Bop's".

             Tetris

           <div class="box-body">
			Javascript, which I am passingly familiar with, is a language that I want to become more 
			familiar with. Furthermore, I want to better understand the process of making a game that
			runs in real time, and I figured that tetris would be a perfect jumping off point. This is
			a base from which I will hopefully make my version of tetris more unique (I have ideas).
