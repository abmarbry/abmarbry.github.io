             Reverse Horoscope

           <div class="box-body">
             I do not believe in Astrology. However, I do believe that what pulls many towards
             Astrology is the act of reading something that seems like it's written for them
             and deciding whether or not it applies to them. Why not take out the middle man?
             In my Reverse Horoscope, I take daily horoscopes from other websites, teaching
             myself how to web scrape with JSoup, and have the user select which body of text
             applies to them in a two-part quiz, then saying which "sign" they are based on
             their answers.

           <div class="box-body">
			   ScoobieCipher is, in short, an RSA program that includes a secondary decorative cipher that I
			   made originally.
			   My Object-Oriented Programming class originally inspired this programs with the homework 
			   of creating a cipher, though none of the code here is from the homework (in which I used 
			   a double Xor method). This was also inspired from a presentation a professor, Dr. Bidner,
			   gave at an Association of Computing Machinery meeting where he discussed how to implement 
			   RSA. Though much of it was new to me, and therefore challenging at times, the most 
			   time-consuming aspect was implementing the ScoobieCipher on top of RSA. This also happened 
			   to be the most rewarding feature, as seeing a sequences of bytes is not nearly as fun as 
			   seeing a sequence of "Scoobie Doo Bop's" that you made entirely on your own.

			After introducing myself to Javascript, I am now working on making a version of 'One
			Night Ultimate Werewolf' using Node.js and jQuery that is personalized to the in-jokes
			my close friends and I have developed while playing 'One Night' ourselves. My goal is
			to make a purely mobile version of the game that will both make playing it more convenient
			(as Tim commonly forgets to bring the game) and will remove much of the metagaming that 
			physical games can lend themselves to.
