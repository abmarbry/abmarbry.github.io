											I'm a Junior at studying Computer Science & English.

										<div class="desc-p">
											Truman State University, where I attend school, has a strong belief in the value of having a breadth of knowledge. Little is more different than Computer Science and English,
											especially at first glance. However, depending on how you look at the two fields, they can be as similar as they are different. While studying both has made my semesters quite
											busy, I love both too much to give either one up.

										<div class="desc-bold">
											My goal is to become a Software Engineer.
										</div>
										<div class="desc-p">
											If I had to define a Software Engineer to someone unfamiliar with the tech industry, I would say that they are programmers who distinguish themselves by actually liking to talk
											to people. For someone more extroverted like myself, it's the best of both worlds.
										</div>
										
										<div class="desc-bold">
											I write in my free time.
										</div>
										<div class="desc-p">
											If your first response was "what in the world is free time?" you might need a break. Around every other day, I sit down and work on various writing 
											projects. The work is about 20% writing, 80% editing. A number of my pieces (seen below) have been accepted by literary magazines, and a much larger number
											of them are not yet polished enough to send out there.

													In the summer of 2018, I had the lovely opprotunity to work in the Information Systems Department at Edward Jones. Thoughout the ten weeks, I did the following:
													<br> <br>
													<ul>
														<li>Created a full-stack web application using Java, SQL, and Javascript to process internal staff transfers from a legacy COBOL program </li>
														<li>The improved UI caused less user-error, and cut down on team workload by around 35 hours a month </li>
														<li>Participated in frequent networking events and presented project to the Information Systems department</li>
													</ul>
													
													The technologies used includes Apache Maven, Apache Struts 2, Jersey (REST Services), Jenkins, JUnit, Oracle SQL with MyBatis, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
													I learned a majority of these technologies, especially the Apache products, throughout the internship.

													This is a daily quiz created in Java to determine one's "true" star sign by scraping popular astrological websites and asking which daily horoscopes apply
													most to the person. It then calculates what percent someone is Cancer, Leo, etc. based on their answers. <br><br>
													As someone who is of the belief that horoscopes are
													intentionally vague so that they apply to everyone's lives, I would be interested to know what the results would be if this program was used on a large scale.
													<br><br>
													Throughout this project, I learned web scraping with JSoup and better familiarized myself with Java's File I/O as well as its persistent storage.

													This is an implementation of RSA that I was inspired to implement after a talk on basic encryption at an ACM meeting. This takes speech from the text
													box, encrypts it with RSA, and then changes the text from hexidecimal characters to "Scoobie Speak." It can also translate from "Scoobie Speak" to English.
													<br><br>
													Throughout this project, I learned a good deal about encryption, hexidecimal behavior, and how to manage Java's GUI tools.

													Every week throughout the school year, one professor, three graduate students, and three undergraduates (myself included) review a series of short fiction
