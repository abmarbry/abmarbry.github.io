           As mentioned in my About Me, I am the Assistant Editor-in-Chief of Windfall Literary
           Magazine. Truman students, known for their writing skill, submit creative pieces to
           the magazine that we all personally look over and discuss. As assistant, I co-lead
           the critical discussions, and do wha our Editor-in-Chief needs done.

          <div class="box-body">
          "Scuba Girl" is a flash fiction that I published on Daily Science Fiction. I wrote it
          after spending 14 hours over the course of two days trying to edit fiction that would
          go on to be much less successful. Its success was a strange mix between enjoying the
          miracle of writing a decent story by pure inspiration, and respect for the hours of
          hard work that brought me to that point.
